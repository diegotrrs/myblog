Good practices, such as keeping things simple and small, and keeping things familiar together can be seen from different perspectives:

- From a function point of view, it might mean short functions that do one thing & with a few parameters.
- From a component point of view, it might mean a cohesive folder structure & good dependencies.
- From an architecture point of view, it might mean micro-services with their own database or a modular monolith.

It really doesnâ€™t matter the specific scenario, what matters is that we are comfortable with those good practices
and how we can change the perspective or depth we see things from.
